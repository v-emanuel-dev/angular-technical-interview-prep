    <h1 class="text-center">Angular Architectural Approaches</h1>
    <p>
      There are several different architectural approaches you can use when building an Angular application, each with
      its own set of trade-offs and benefits. Here are some of the most common ones:
    </p>
    <p>
      Component-Based Architecture: This is the default architecture used in Angular, where the application is built
      using components. Components are the building blocks of an Angular application, and they contain the HTML, CSS,
      and JavaScript required to render a portion of the user interface.
    </p>
    <p>
      NGRX: NGRX is a popular state management library for Angular, and it uses reactive programming concepts to manage
      the state of your application. NGRX provides a centralized store for your application's state, making it easier to
      manage and update the state of your application, as well as respond to changes in the state.
    </p>
    <p>
      Microfrontends: Microfrontends are a way of breaking down a monolithic frontend into smaller, more manageable
      pieces. This can make your application easier to develop and maintain, as well as improve the performance and
      scalability of your application.
    </p>
    <p>
      Domain-Driven Design (DDD): DDD is an architectural pattern that focuses on separating the application into
      distinct domains, each with its own set of rules and behaviors. This can make your application easier to
      understand and maintain, as well as improve its ability to scale and evolve over time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clean Architecture: Clean Architecture is an architectural pattern that emphasizes separation of concerns and the
      use of dependency injection to make your code more modular and testable. This can make your application easier to
      maintain and improve its overall quality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Model-View-Presenter (MVP): MVP is an architectural pattern that separates the presentation logic from the
      business logic, making it easier to write and maintain your code. This can also make it easier to test your
      application, as you can write tests for the presentation and business logic separately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each of these architectural approaches has its own set of benefits and trade-offs, and the best one for you will
      depend on the specific requirements of your application. However, by using one or more of these approaches, you
      can create a more scalable, maintainable, and testable Angular application.
